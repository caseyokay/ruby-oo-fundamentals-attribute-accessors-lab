## code your solution here. 
class Cat
attr_accessor :name

def meow
    puts "meow!"

# maru = Cat.new
# maru.name = "Maru"

# maru.name
# maru.meow

#Define a class, called Cat.
#Use the attr_accessor macro to create a setter and getter method for a cat's name.
#Write a method, .meow, that outputs "meow!" 
#to the terminal using the puts method when called on an instance of Cat.
